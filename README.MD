*Stack.gl - browser edition*

Entirely against the whole [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and the ideals of stack.gl itself, but here it is, a pre-packaged, browser-ready, bundle of all the cool shit you'll find in [stack.gl](http://stack.gl/). Contains the core stack.gl modules plus a few extras for kicks.

This probably won't be up-to-date with the latest stack.gl modules, so be warned.
